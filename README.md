## Assigment Summary:

For this assignment we are tasked with building and evaluate several machine learning mdels to predict credit risks using data from peer-to-peer lending services.

Credit risk is seen inherently as an imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans).

To counter this issue we employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. 

This is done utilising the following techniques:

### Resampling:

```
Split the Data into Training and Testing.
Data Pre-Processing.
Simple Losgistic Regrression.
Oversampling (Naive Random Oversampling and SMOTE).
Undersampling (ClusterCentroids function).
Combination Sampling (Over and Under).
```
